Recurrence relation : T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-3) + T(n-5)

Intuitively, we can view our problem from top down. The only way to get to
step n is to jump from level n-1, from level n-3, or from level n-5.

We can recursively follow this pattern to reach our recurrence relation. 

Additionally, we establish the following base cases:

    dp[0]=0;
    dp[1]=1;
    dp[2]=1;
    dp[3]=2;
    dp[4]=3;
    dp[5]=5;
 
in order for our recurrence relation to properly work.
